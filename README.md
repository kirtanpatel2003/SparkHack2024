Web Application Project Description
This document provides a detailed overview of our newly developed web application designed to simplify the process of finding a mutually convenient meeting point between two locations. This innovative tool ensures that both parties travel approximately the same distance, making meetups fair and accessible.

Technologies Used
The web application is built using a robust stack of modern technologies, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience. The core technologies used in the development of this application include HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Flask (a Python web framework), and Open Street Map API for accurate mapping and geolocation services.

How It Works - Step-by-Step Guide
Our web application offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, guiding users through the process of finding a midpoint for their meetings. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use the application:
1.	 Start on our homepage where you will see a few options to choose from.
2.	 Look for the search bar that asks for your friend's location/address and type it in.
3.	 After entering the location, the web app will display your friend's location on the map.
4.	 Your current location will be pinpointed next to your friend's on the map.
5.	 Finally, the app will calculate and display a midpoint between you and your friend's location.

Conclusion

This web application stands out as a practical tool for individuals looking to meet up without the hassle of long travel times or unfair distance differences.
